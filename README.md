**Tic-Tac-Toe Game Description**  

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns marking spaces on a grid, aiming to form a winning sequence. This implementation includes the following enhanced features:  

1. **Customizable Board Size** – Instead of a fixed 3x3 grid, players can choose the board size at the start of the game (e.g., 4x4, 5x5). This adds complexity and requires additional logic to determine victory conditions.  

2. **Game Statistics Tracking** – The game keeps track of player wins, losses, and the number of draws during a session. This statistical data is displayed at the end of each round.  

3. **Colored Move Display** – Using the `colorama` module, player symbols ("X" and "O") are displayed in different colors, improving the game's visual appeal in the console.
